# Modernism in Graphic Design
#### A lecture by Hidde de Vries - Accessibility and CSS expert at W3C - february 13th

## About Hidde De Vries
Hidde de Vries is an accessibility specialist and web developer, working for W3C. He's concerned with web standards and the development of new web technologies. One of the main projects he has been working on was css grids. Today his lecture was about the history of graphic design and our role as developers in this line of industry.

## Modernism in Graphic Design
These days, there are a lot of websites that very much look the same, while there's a lot more options in online graphic design. This is the result of modernistic thinking following the idea of 'form follows function', according to which design is subordinate to the function of technological solutions.

Hidde de Vries wanted to remind us of what's at all possible with CSS and told us a bit about past developments in graphic design.

### Jan Tschichold

The first person in his story was Jan Tschichold. Tschichold is the author of 'Die neue Typographie.' In this book he wrote down rules for standardization of practices relating to modern type usage. He condemned all typefaces except for sans-serif types, advocated standardized sizes of paper and set forth guidelines for establishing a typographic hierarchy when using type in design. [(1)][1]

He also expounded on asymmetrical layouts where the eyes are lead from the one word to the other.

### Josef Müller-Brockmann

The second person who has been important for graphic design is Josef Müller-Brockmann. He was a Swiss graphic designer and teacher who studied architecture, design and history of art.[(2)][2] He wrote a book called "Grid Systems in Graphic Design." This book provides guidelines and rules for grid systems and shows examples of how these work.[(3)][3]

Previously we had to calculate the positions of elements in the browser using JavaScript, but now we can use grids and fractional units in CSS. This makes it a lot easier to use grids to create designs that previously were really hard to accomplish and enables us to play with proportions.

### Wim Crouwel

Then there's Wim Crouwel, a typographer pur sang. He developed the "New Alphabet." In his designs he didn't use depth or perspective. He only used color and typography.[(4)][4] He aimed to create a typography that was a better fit for modern techniques, which was why he didn't use round shapes and developed grids based fonts. These fonts are also very helpful for automated form handling.

Because of new technical solutions like retina displays, round shapes can now be used

### Piet Schreuders

Another Dutch graphic designer was Piet Schreuders. He was against previous developments, because in his opinion it got too boring. According to Schreuders, we should take the good things from modernism, but make it more interesting to look at.

### Mark Boulton

Boulton is a design director, writer and speaker who reproduced modernistic poster designs with css (without grids)

Nowadays, there's two new features: flexbox and grid. These features allow us to position elements easily and create more interesting designs.

### Chen Hui Jing

According to Chen Hui Jing, we should always first sketch a grid and then make our design

### Jen Simmons

The last person in de Vries' story is Jen Simmons. According to her frameworks abstract standards, but the closer you keep your work aligned to those standards, the more flexibility remains.

## Web vs graphic design
Web design has a lot of special qualities. When compared to graphic design, the most important advantages are that web design is more flexible, interactive, has better accessibility and is built on standards.

### It's more flexible

Web design is way more flexible. You can for example change the sizes of all elements, fonts and colors.

### It's more interactive

Because it's possible to hide or show things and animate elements using CSS, web design can easily be made interactive in ways that can never be achieved with graphic design.
</details>

### It's more accessible

  Because web design is mostly text, it's possible to **select**, **copy** and **translate** parts of web pages. This helps at creating more accessible designs.

### It's built on standards
