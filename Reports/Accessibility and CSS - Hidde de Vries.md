### Jan Tschichold
![Jan Tschichold][Jan Tschichold]

- Die neue Typografie 
- function more imoportant than form. (form follows function)
- asymmetrical alignment
- the eyes are lead from the one word to the other

### Josef M端ller-Brockmann
![Josef M端ller-Brockmann][Josef M端ller-Brockmann]
- Grids
- functional, logical, more beautiful
- grid fields as basis for design
- play with proportion

### Wim Crouwel
![Wim Crouwel][Wim Crouwel]
- New Alphabet, because round shapes didn't do right
- These days, because of technical developments like retina displays, round shapes kan be used.

--------------------
A lot of developments, because of company identities
70's, 80's: grid based fonts

grid based fonts are also very helpful for automating form interpretation

--------------------

### Piet Schreuders
![Piet Schreuders][Piet Schreuders]
- He was against this development, because it was boring.
- Making things too functional makes them boring
- Take the good things from modernism, but don't make it boring
- deduce rules from design 

## CSS

### Mark Boulton
![Mark Boulton][Mark Boulton]
- reproduced modernistic poster designs with css (without grids)

Now there's two new features: flexbox and grid

### Chen Hui Jing
![Chen Hui Jing][Chen Hui Jing]
- First sketch a grid, then make your design

---------------------
Web vs graphic design
- flexible
  - canvas
  - text
  - colors
- interactive
  - hide and show
  - animate
- mostly text
  - accessible
    - select
    - copy
    - translate
- built on standards
---------------------

### Jen Simmons

- frameworks abstract standards, but the closer you keep your works aligned, the more flexibility remains.
- choose vanilla
