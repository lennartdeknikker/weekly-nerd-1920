# Code and UX
#### A Lecture by Sanne 't Hoofd - february 19th

## About Sanne 't Hoofd
Sanne 't Hoofd is lecturer at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. During this lecture, he showed us some examples of beautiful CSS creations by some of his students as well as some of his own work. The goal of this lecture was to inspire us to be more creative in our own work and make us aware of what can be achieved using just some CSS.

## Micro Interactions
't Hoofd gave us three characteristics that together define micro interactions.
1. A signature moment in a digital product (site, app, ...)
2. A Product based around one micro-interaction
3. People see interaction with a digital product as a series of micro interactions.

Each interaction can be broken down using the model below:


## Spelen met CSS
't Hoofd started off showing us some examples of [these works by his students](https://www.sinds1971.nl/spelenmetcss/index.html). 

## The Carousel
As last example he showed us how he build [a 3D carousel](https://codepen.io/shooft/pen/zYGppvK). He showed us how he started on this project, the sketches he made and what math he used to calculate the positions and size of all the carousel items. What impressed me most was that it was possible to add a huge amount of items to the carousel without slowing it down. It did get slower when we tried to find out how far we could stretch the amount, but it seemed to be a lot lighter than when you would try the same using just javaScript.
