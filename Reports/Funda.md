FUNDA - Scrum and POC - february 26th
# Funda Scrum Workshop
#### A workshop to learn to scrum and to work on different features as one team. - February 26th

## About the workshop
Based in Amsterdam, the Funda office building hosted this workshop for us, so we could find out how they work on their projects. The workshop was lead by Lars Douwe Schuitema, a frontend web developer who studied CMD himself and then got a job at Funda.

## About Funda
Funda is an online platform where people can offer real estate. In fifteen years it grew to be the biggest website connecting consumers and estate agents.

## What we did
For this workshop we were divided in multiple teams. Each team is provided with a coach and each team had to bring one person forward to take the role of scrum master. Starting off, all scrum masters got together and received instructions on leading their teams. Meanwhile the teams all received information on the features each team got assigned.

When our scrum master got back, the timer started and in 1.5 hours we had to build our part of the Funda application. Our assignment entailed building a filter function. The project was set up in Vue and since I was the only one in our team that had some experience working with that framework, I tried to take the lead in writing the actual code. Another team member started on the CSS to make our feature look nice. 

I found it hard to work with this many people on the same small part of the application. It was especially hard to communicate what we all were working on and keep everyone busy doing something.

Afterwards all our features were pushed to github, merged and then we evaluated all teams progress. Not all teams got to finish their features, but it was nice to see how much can be achieved when working together. 

## Reflection
I think this workshop wasn't that well prepared and the teams were too big to work on the small features we had to build. Our coach didn't do much more than just watch us working and helping out a bit when we didn't know what to do. It was nice to get a look inside the Funda Office Building, but I'm not sure I learnt anything new. It would have been nice if they first provided an introduction to working with the vue framework and showing the application architecture. We could then have asked some questions about why they chose to build it that way, learn from that and then work on our features already knowing what we would be dealing with instead of just getting thrown into figuring out the application architecture ourselves and stressfully try to add our feature within the time we got left.
