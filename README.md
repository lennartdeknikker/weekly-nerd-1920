# Weekly Nerd
In the wiki of this repository, you can find my reports on workshops and lectures as well as the articles I wrote myself.

I wrote these reports and articles as those were assignments for the course called [weekly nerd](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/weekly-nerd-1920) which is part of the [minor Web Development](https://everythingweb.org/) at the [Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences](https://www.amsterdamuas.com/).
