# The new features of EcmaScript 2020
**Lennart de Knikker | June 30th 2020**

Earlier this month EcmaScript2020 was released. JavaScript is a rapidly changing language with a very big user base. Since it's sixth edition, released in June 2015, every year around the same time a new version of EcmaScript has been released and every time it's been exciting to see what has changed. As Carlos Caballero stated in his article "JavaScript ES2020 Features With Simple Examples" as well as Mehul Mohan in "10 New JavaScript Features in ES2020 That You Should Know", this consistency in its development evidently shows that JavaScript is still very much alive and undergoing vibrant evolution. [(1)][1][(2)][2]

This new version brings us about 10 new features developers can use.

For all these new features more accurate information, examples and browser compatibility can be found in the [MDN web documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/), so at the end of each feature, you'll find a link to the corresponding MDN documentation.

I copied most code examples from [v8.dev](https://v8.dev/) since these show the usage of each new feature very clearly.


## BigInt
As defined on v8.dev:

> BigInts are a new numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary precision. With BigInts, you can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit for Numbers. [(3)][3]

Before ES2020, the maximum number to be represented by an integer was 2<sup>53</sup> - 1. [(4)][4]
This new way to define  integers opens up opportunities for larger mathmatical operations.

***Sidenote**: It cannot be used with methods in the built-in Math object and cannot be mixed with instances of Number in operations; they must be coerced to the same type.* [(5)][5]

### Usage

There's two ways to use this new feature. Either by putting an `n` at the end of the number or by using the  `BigInt()` function.
```js
const theBiggestInt = 9007199254740991n
const alsoHuge = BigInt(9007199254740991)
```

## dynamic imports
> This feature introduces a new function-like form of import that unlocks new capabilities compared to static import.[(6)][6]

This new feature makes it possible to import modules conditionally. Before it was only possible to use import statements at the top-level.

A second adventage is that it now enables us to import modules from within a regular script. That means it's even possible to use import statements within asynchronous functions.

### Usage
```js
<script type="module">
  const moduleSpecifier = './utils.mjs';
  import(moduleSpecifier)
    .then((module) => {
      module.default();
      // → logs 'Hi from the default export!'
      module.doStuff();
      // → logs 'Doing stuff…'
    });
</script>
```

## nullish coalescing
This is one of the features I'm a bit more excited about. This logical operator returns what's on the right hand side when the value on the left-hand side is either `null` or `undefined`. It's syntax is the same as the other logical operators like `&&` and `||`. [(7)][7] 

Read more about the problems this new feature solves [here](https://v8.dev/features/nullish-coalescing). 

### Usage
```js
false ?? true;   // => false
0 ?? 1;          // => 0
'' ?? 'default'; // => ''

null ?? [];      // => []
undefined ?? []; // => []
```

## optional chaining
When an object property name does not exist, it returns `null` or `undefined`. This can easily lead to errors. To solve this problem before ES2020 you would have to check for the existence of any property before assessing it's value. This results in a lot of if-statements and can make your code a lot less readable. With this new feature, you can just put an `?` in front of the property name and that problem is solved. When the property name does not exist it now just returns `undefined` instead of creating errors stopping the remaining code to run.[(8)][8]


### Usage
```js
// `db.user` is deleted only if `db` is defined.
delete db?.user;
```

***[MDN link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining)***

## promise.allSettled
This new function can be used to indicate whether all input promises are settled. It doesn't check whether they are all fulfilled or rejected, but just returns when they are all done. Used in an async await structure you can then write code that will run afterwards.[(9)][9]

### Usage
```js
const promises = [
  fetch('/api-call-1'),
  fetch('/api-call-2'),
  fetch('/api-call-3'),
];
// Imagine some of these requests fail, and some succeed.

await Promise.allSettled(promises);
// All API calls have finished (either failed or succeeded).
removeLoadingIndicator();
```

***[MDN link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled)***

## String#matchAll
This function makes it easier to loop over a string and get all the objects that match. Before ES2020 you could use string.match, and write a for of loop to get all matches, but that would only return the substring and no information on the index or the capturing groups within each match.[(10)][10]

### Usage
```js
const string = 'Magic hex numbers: DEADBEEF CAFE';
const regex = /\b\p{ASCII_Hex_Digit}+\b/gu;
for (const match of string.matchAll(regex)) {
  console.log(match);
}

// Output:
//
// [ 'DEADBEEF', index: 19, input: 'Magic hex numbers: DEADBEEF CAFE' ]
// [ 'CAFE',     index: 28, input: 'Magic hex numbers: DEADBEEF CAFE' ]
```

***[MDN link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt)***

## globalThis
Before this new feature was introduced, there was a different approach between client side javascript and nodeJS for accessing the global this-object. In NodeJS you would use `global`, in client side javaScript you would use the `window` object and in service workers you would use `self`. The globalThis property standardizes the way the global this value is accessed. [(11)][11]

### Usage
Instead of doing this:
```js
var getGlobal = function () { 
  if (typeof self !== 'undefined') { return self; } 
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { return window; } 
  if (typeof global !== 'undefined') { return global; } 
  throw new Error('unable to locate global object'); 
}; 

var globals = getGlobal(); 

if (typeof globals.setTimeout !== 'function') { 
  // no setTimeout in this environment! 
}
```

, we can now do this:
```js
if (typeof globalThis.setTimeout !== 'function') {
  // no setTimeout in this environment!
}
```

As you can see, it saves a lot of lines of code to check which global environment is available. Instead we just have to check if the property or method we're looking for exists within this environment.

## module namespace exports
It was possible already to import modules like this:
```js
import * as module from './module.mjs';
```
However to export a module, we had to do it like this:
```js
export { module };
```
Now to export modules we can symmetrically use the same syntax as we use for import statements: [(12)][12]
```js
export * as module from './module.mjs'
```

***[MDN link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)***

## well defined for-in order
In earlier versions it was not specified in what order a `for(.. in ..)` statement should run. This has now been standardized [(13)][13]

***[MDN link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in)***

## import.meta
This new property of the import object exposes metadata on imported modules. This way it's for example possible to retrieve the exact url for an import file, but the import property can also be used to write additional metadata onto.[(14)][14]

### Usage
```js
console.log(import.meta); // { url: "file:///home/user/my-module.js" }
```
***[MDN link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import.meta)***


## Conclusions
Even though not all features seem useful to me personally right now, it's good to keep track of all changes and be aware that JavaScript will keep changing in an effort to make our lives easier and easier. It can take time to adopt new syntax in building your own projects, but eventually it will pay. Even though some of these features don't seem important now, you will never know when some of it might come in handy.
