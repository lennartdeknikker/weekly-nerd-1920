# What's new in ES2020?
**Lennart de Knikker | June 30th 2020**

Earlier this month EcmaScript2020 was released. JavaScript is a rapidly changing language with a very big user base. Since it's sixth edition, released in June 2015, every year around the same time a new version of EcmaScript has been released and every time it's been exciting to see what has changed. As Carlos Caballero stated in his article "JavaScript ES2020 Features With Simple Examples" as well as Mehul Mohan in "10 New JavaScript Features in ES2020 That You Should Know", this consistency in its development evidently shows that JavaScript is still very much alive and undergoing vibrant evolution. [(1)][1][(2)][2]

This new version brings us about 10 new features developers can use.

For all these new features more accurate information, examples and browser compatibility can be found in the [MDN web documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/), so at the end of each feature, you'll find a link to the corresponding MDN documentation.

## BigInt
As defined on v8.dev:

> BigInts are a new numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary precision. With BigInts, you can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit for Numbers. 

Before ES2020, the maximum number to be represented by an integer was 2<sup>53</sup> - 1. [(3)][3]
This new way to define  integers opens up opportunities for larger mathmatical operations.

***sidenote**:  it cannot be used with methods in the built-in Math object and cannot be mixed with instances of Number in operations; they must be coerced to the same type. *
